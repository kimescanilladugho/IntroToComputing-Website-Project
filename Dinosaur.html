      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triceratops is a genus of chasmosaurine ceratopsian dinosaur that lived during the late 
      Maastrichtian age of  the Late Cretaceous period, about 68 to 66 million years ago in what is 
      now western North. Triceratops is one of the most well-known and iconic  dinosaurs, 
      characterized by its large size and distinctive features. Triceratops  belongs to the family

      America, Europe, and possibly  parts of Africa. Allosaurus was one of the top predators of its 
      time and is known for its large size, powerful jaws filled with serrated teeth, and its bipedal 
      stance.</p>

      during the Early Cretaceous period. The name "Baryonyx" means "heavy claw," referring to its large, 
      curved claws. This dinosaur belongs to the spinosaurid group, which includes other large, 
      carnivorous dinosaurs characterized by their long, crocodile-like snouts. </p>

      115 to 108 million years ago. The name Deinonychus, which means "terrible claw" in Greek, is derived 
      from its distinctive  large, curved talon on each hind foot. These claws were likely used as a 
      predatory tool, allowing Deinonychus  to grasp and immobilize its prey.</p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilophosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic period, around 
      193 million years ago. The name "Dilophosaurus" is derived from the Greek words "di," meaning two, 
      and "lophos," meaning crest, referring to the double crests on the top of its skull.</p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spinosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period, approximately 
      112 to 93 million years ago. The name "Spinosaurus" means "spine lizard," which refers to the 
      distinctive sail-like structure on its back, formed by elongated neural spines. This dinosaur is 
      known for being one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs, possibly even larger than Tyrannosaurus

    <h3>RAPTOR</h3>

      are characterized by their bird-like features and predatory adaptations. The most famous member of 
      this  group is the Velociraptor, which gained widespread recognition through movies like "Jurassic 
      Park." It's  important to note that the term "raptor" itself is not a scientific classification but 
      rather a popularized term.</p>
