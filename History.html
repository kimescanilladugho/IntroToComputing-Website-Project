        <h1 class="h11">The Mesozoic Era, spanning from approximately 252 million years ago to 66 million years ago, witnessed the rise and fall of dinosaurs a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth for millions of years. This era is divided into three main periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.</h1>

          <h2>➢Triassic Period (252-201 million years ago): </h2>
          
          <p class="paragraph">
            •Pangaea: The supercontinent where Earth's landmasses were joined together.
            •Climate: Generally hot and arid.
            •Dinosaur Evolution: Dinosaurs evolved from earlier reptiles, with the first ones being small  
            and bipedal.
            •Coexistence: Dinosaurs coexisted with other reptilian groups.</p>
          
          <h2>➢Jurassic Period (201-145 million years ago): </h2>
          
           <p class="paragraph">
            •Pangaea Breakup: The gradual separation of landmasses. 
            •Changing Climates: Resulted in diverse ecosystems.
            •Dinosaur Diversity: Dinosaurs diversified and became widespread.
            •Iconic Dinosaurs: Brachiosaurus, Stegosaurus, Allosaurus.
            •Evolution of Birds: First birds evolved from small, feathered dinosaurs.
        </p>
         
        <h2>➢Cretaceous Period (145-66 million years ago): </h2>

           <p class="paragraph">
            
            •Continued Diversification: Large herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs thrived.
            •Influence of Flowering Plants: Widespread flowering plants affected herbivorous dinosaur 
            evolution.
            •Mass Extinction Event (66 million years ago): A catastrophic event leading to the end of the 
            dinosaur era.</p>


          <h2>➢Causes of Mass Extinction: </h2>
          
          <p class="paragraph"> 
            •Impact Event: Large asteroid or comet impact, creating the Chicxulub crater and causing 
            wildfires, tsunamis, and a "nuclear winter" effect.
            •Volcanic Activity: Intense volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps region (present-day India) 
            contributed to environmental stress. </p>
          
          <h2>➢Consequences: </h2>
          
          <p class="paragraph">
            •Dramatic climate changes: Drop in temperatures, decreased sunlight, disrupted ecosystems.
            •Extinction: Many species, including the majority of dinosaurs, went extinct.</p>

          <h2>➢Aftermath: </h2>
          
          <p class="paragraph">
            •Survival of Some Lineages: Birds evolved from dinosaur lineages and survived.
            •Mammalian Diversification: Mammals, once inconspicuous, underwent significant diversification 
            in the absence of large dinosaurs.
            •Rise of Humans: The evolutionary path led to the rise of various mammalian species, including 
            humans.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">
            The Mesozoic Era left an indelible mark on Earth's history, showcasing the rise and fall of 
            dinosaurs and the subsequent evolution of life. While the non-avian dinosaurs faced 
            extinction, their legacy endures through the evolutionary journey of surviving lineages, 
            including the remarkable emergence of birds and mammals.</p>
